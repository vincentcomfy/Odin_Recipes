        It all started one crisp autumn morning while I was hiking through the serene Italian Alps. I had stopped 
        for a brief rest at a quaint little mountain village when, to my surprise, none other than <strong>Guy Fieri</strong> 
        himself stumbled upon the same hidden gem. We bonded over the local cheeses and herbs, both marveling at 
        the freshness of the ingredients. As the sun set behind the snow-capped peaks, we decided to collaborate on 
        the ultimate lasagna, blending traditional flavors with a modern twist—layering in love, garlic, and just 
        the right amount of ricotta. That night, under the alpine stars, the recipe was born.

        Alright, everyone! Let’s roll up our sleeves and dive into this delightful lasagna adventure! 
        With a sprinkle of love and a dash of enthusiasm, we’re about to transform simple ingredients 
        into a hearty masterpiece that will warm your heart and fill your belly!
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375F (190C)</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Meat Sauce:</strong> In a large skillet, heat a bit of olive oil over medium heat. 
            Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until fragrant. Then, add the ground beef and pork (if using),
             cooking until browned. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, red wine (if using), sugar, 
             basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture:</strong> In a bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, grated Parmesan cheese, 
            and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Place a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add half of the ricotta mixture, spreading it evenly.</li>
                <li>Top with a third of the meat sauce and a sprinkle of mozzarella cheese.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, ricotta, meat sauce, and mozzarella.</li>
                <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles, the remaining meat sauce, and a generous topping of mozzarella cheese.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the dish with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, spray the foil with cooking spray). 
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Let it Rest:</strong> Once baked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing. This will help it hold its shape when served.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong> Cut into squares, serve warm, and enjoy your delicious homemade lasagna!</li>
    </ol>
